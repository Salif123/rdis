                    <br>
                    Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) patients represent a crucial demographic in healthcare,
                    encompassing women of reproductive age, pregnant mothers, newborns, and children under five years.
                    These patients require comprehensive care that includes regular health check-ups, immunizations, nutritional support,
                    and specialized medical attention during pregnancy and childbirth.
                        The RCH program focuses on reducing maternal and infant mortality rates while ensuring the overall well-being
                        of both mother and child through various stages of pregnancy,
                    delivery, and early childhood development.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The care of RCH patients extends beyond just medical treatment, incorporating vital aspects such as family planning services,
                     prenatal and postnatal care, growth monitoring, and early childhood disease prevention.
                      Healthcare providers work closely with these patients to address common health challenges,
                       provide nutritional guidance, and ensure timely vaccinations.
                        Special attention is also given to high-risk pregnancies, adolescent mothers,
                         and children with developmental concerns,
                          making RCH care a cornerstone of public health initiatives aimed at building a healthier future generation.
